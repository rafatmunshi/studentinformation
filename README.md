# studentinformation
Student registration and information portal using PHP, MySQL

This web based application system will be a Student Registration System for a student of the university as well as the administrator of the application. This system will be designed to register students for the particular semesters in the various courses offered by the University. It shall provide a one stop place for students to register, view and edit their details as well as the admin for viewing all students in the course and edit student and course information, which would have been much difficult with paper work and files. By maximizing the student’s and admin’s work efficiency, the system will meet the university’s needs and requirements while remaining easy to understand and use.
The system also contains a relational database containing a list of courses with their maximum limit, All student details, and hostel details.
