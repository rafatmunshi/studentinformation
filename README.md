Student registration and information portal using PHP, MySQL

This is a simple register and login portal where students of a university can register themselves and save their details and update them.
They can upload their photographs. Lastly their information is saved as a pdf file as well which they can download for their use.
The features and other information of this project is given elaborately in the Software Requirements specifications and Software Design Document.
So please go through them once to have a complete idea about this project.
